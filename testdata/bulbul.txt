The bulbuls are a family, Pycnonotidae, of medium-sized passerine songbirds. 
Many forest species are known as greenbuls, brownbuls, leafloves, or bristlebills. 
The family is distributed across most of Africa and into the Middle East, 
tropical Asia to Indonesia, and north as far as Japan. 
A few insular species occur on the tropical islands of the Indian Ocean. 
There are over 150 species in 27 genera. While different species are found in a wide range of habitats, 
the African species are predominantly found in rainforest. Rainforest species are rare in Asia, 
however, with Asian bulbuls preferring more open areas.
